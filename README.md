# PROJECT NAME
jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 2-Day Project_

This project seeks to create an employee salary calculator that allows the user to input the following employee information: first name, last name, employee ID, job title, and annual salary.  This employee information is then displayed on the page, along with the overall monthly salary of all employees. If the overally monthly cost exceeds the monthly budget, the total monthly salary acquires a red background and a red WARNING message is displayed.  An employee can also be deleted and the monthly cost is adjusted accordingly.

2. Enter the desired data on a new employee.
3. Click 'Submit' to submit the data.
4. Click 'Delete' to delete the employee data.
